And the real problem is not AI, it\u2019s data.\n\nYou\u2019ll spend most of your time wrangling messy real-world data rather than playing with the latest shiny AI tool.\n\nSo when someone tells me about 10 new advanced RAG methods they\u2019ve learned or a fancy multi-agent system they\u2019re excited about, my first question is: Does it actually work for your problem, your data, your business? How do you plan to evaluate it?\n\nFunny enough, but if you're always chasing the latest trends, you\u2019ll never actually catch up, because you don\u2019t know why, where, or when they should be used.",

A group of folks have launched a YouTube series called 'Building DeepSeek from Scratch' to teach how you can create your own mini-DeepSeek.\n\nRaj Abhijit and team are putting together a series of 15-minute videos, covering 40+ hours of content on how to build DeepSeek-like reasoning models.\n\nKey topics covered:\n1. Mixture of Experts (MoE)\n2. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)\n3. Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE)\n4. Multi-token Prediction (MTP)\n5. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\n6. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\n\nIn Raj\u2019s words:\n'After this, you\u2019ll be among the top 0.1% of ML/LLM engineers who can build DeepSeek\u2019s core ingredients on their own.'\n\nI watched the first video, and it looks promising. While I believe things can get exponentially more complex at scale, where DeepSeek-R1\u2019s real strength lies, building a small version to understand the core concepts seems like a valuable learning experience!",
